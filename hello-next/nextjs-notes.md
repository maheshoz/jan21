### NOTE

1. Next.js is serverside(sends html content/pages for routes same as static not just js code) not a SPA(no reload for getting the pages,mostly) like react apps
2. there are some `seo` and `performance` benefits

INSTALLING NEXT.JS
- have node installed
- then run the cmd in shell
- `npx create-next-app hello-next` or `npx create-next-app hello-next --use-npm` if we have yarn installed but we wanna use npm
- cd into the created dir and run `npm run dev` in shell
